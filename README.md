## 📖 Usage Guide

### Step 1: 🔍 Analyze

- Shows progress in real-time

This process:

---

### Step 3: ✅ Verify

Compare both systems to ensure 100% data integrity.

Verification checks:

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What happens if I deactivate during migration?

The process will stop, but no data will be lost. You can reactivate and continue.

### Do I need to keep this plugin installed?

After successful migration and cleanup, you can safely deactivate and delete this plugin.

No, if you follow the process correctly, all favorites will be preserved perfectly.

### Does this work with multisite?

Currently, this plugin is designed for single-site installations. Multisite support is planned for future versions.
